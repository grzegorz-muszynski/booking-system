# The booking system
## Description
The web application I developed for a massage salon is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline both client interactions and administrative tasks. The first part of the app allows clients to easily [book appointments online](https://appointment-booking-six.vercel.app), providing a [user-friendly interface](https://appointment-booking-six.vercel.app/dashboard) to select available time slots and services. The second part features a dashboard for salon staff, enabling them to manage content, update available hours, and oversee bookings efficiently. While the codebase remains a business secret, I can reveal that the application was built using modern technologies, including **Next.js** for the framework, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Shadcn** for UI components, **Neon Console** for database management, and **SMSAPI** for SMS notifications to keep clients informed. This dual functionality ensures a seamless experience for both clients and the salon management, enhancing overall productivity and customer satisfaction.
